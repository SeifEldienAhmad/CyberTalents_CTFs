## 🏁 My First CTF Challenge!

This was my **very first CTF challenge** on CyberTalents, and it introduced me to the fundamentals of web application security. The challenge was titled **"Admin has the power"**, and it revolved around finding and accessing a hidden or weakly protected admin panel.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to inspect website structure and functionality using browser DevTools.
- The importance of predictable admin URLs and insecure authentication.
- How to read and analyze code (HTML/JS) for clues that might help bypass login systems.
- That even simple misconfigurations can lead to serious security issues.

Although it was a beginner-level challenge, it gave me a solid entry point into the world of ethical hacking and Capture The Flag competitions.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Browser DevTools** – for inspecting page elements, scripts, and network activity.
- **External IDE** – for easier reading and formatting of copied source code.
- **Logical reasoning** – to test assumptions and identify weak spots manually.

## 📌 Takeaway

This challenge taught me that **you don’t always need advanced tools to hack smart**. A curious mind, a browser, and some basic technical knowledge can go a long way. It was the first step that motivated me to continue learning and solving more complex challenges.
