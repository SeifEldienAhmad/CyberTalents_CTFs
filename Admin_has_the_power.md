## 🏁 My First CTF Challenge!

This was my very first CTF challenge on CyberTalents, and it introduced me to the basics of web security. The challenge was called **"Admin has the power"**, and it focused on understanding how weak admin panels or insecure login mechanisms can be exploited.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to identify common admin login pages.
- The importance of default credentials and weak authentication.
- Basic brute force/login bypass techniques.
- The significance of information disclosure through error messages.

This challenge sparked my interest in web application security and motivated me to dive deeper into Capture The Flag competitions. It also helped me realize how many real-world vulnerabilities stem from simple misconfigurations or overlooked security practices.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Browser DevTools
- Burp Suite (for login testing)
- Wordlists (for basic brute forcing)

---

## 📌 Takeaway

Even simple web challenges can teach powerful lessons. This one taught me that **"with great admin power comes great responsibility"** — and poor login security can lead to big trouble.
