## ⚔️ My Second CTF Challenge

After solving my very first challenge (**Admin has the power**), I moved on to **"This is Sparta"** — a web exploitation challenge that pushed me a little further into analyzing how web apps handle input, navigation, and visibility of content.

The name was catchy, but behind the scenes, the challenge was all about finding hidden clues and understanding basic frontend behavior.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How web elements can be hidden using CSS or JavaScript.
- How to reveal hidden or obscured content using **DevTools**.
- The importance of checking all HTML elements, including comments, hidden fields, or inactive buttons.
- How to decode hexadecimal strings into readable text.
- Gaining confidence in digging deeper into source code and testing ideas independently.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Browser DevTools** – to inspect hidden elements and styles.
- **External IDE** – to format and review page source for readability.
- **Hexadecimal to Text Decoder** – to convert hidden encoded content into plain text (e.g., CyberChef or online hex decoders).
- **Basic intuition and pattern recognition** – to identify where hints might be hidden.

## 📝 My Process (High-Level Overview)

1. Opened the challenge and observed the frontend behavior.
2. Inspected the page using **DevTools** to check for hidden inputs or comments.
3. Copied suspicious content and used a **hex-to-text decoder** to convert it.
4. Reviewed the structure and scripts using an external IDE.
5. Found the clue that led to the flag — often it's a simple but hidden element if you know where to look.

## 📌 Takeaway

**"This is Sparta"** reinforced the idea that **nothing on a webpage is truly hidden** — and that curiosity combined with methodical inspection can uncover vulnerabilities or valuable information.

It was a great follow-up to my first challenge and helped strengthen my skills in client-side inspection, basic encoding/decoding, and web challenge methodology.
