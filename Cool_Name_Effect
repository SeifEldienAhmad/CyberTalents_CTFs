## 🌐 My Fourth CTF Challenge

**"Cool Name Effect"** was the fourth challenge I tackled on CyberTalents. It centered around analyzing **JavaScript effects or events**, and understanding how certain parts of a webpage behave under specific interactions or triggers.

This challenge was a great follow-up to previous ones — but this time, the key was **observing how elements react**, not just how they look.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to trace JavaScript event handlers in web pages.
- How visual effects or dynamic changes can reveal hidden content.
- How to use **DevTools to inspect runtime behavior** of elements.
- That subtle interactions (like hovering, clicking, or focusing) can sometimes expose flags or paths.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Browser DevTools** – to observe scripts, inspect element styles, and follow events.
- **External IDE** – for better formatting and analysis of JavaScript code.
- **Logical experimentation** – to trigger and analyze different effects manually.

## 📝 My Process (High-Level Overview)

1. Opened the challenge and observed the visual layout carefully.
2. Used **DevTools** to inspect elements and check attached event listeners.
3. Reviewed the scripts controlling the interaction or animation effects.
4. Triggered the related effect manually (e.g., hover, click, focus) to reveal a hidden element or flag.
5. Followed the logic to retrieve the flag embedded in the dynamic behavior.

## 📌 Takeaway

**"Cool Name Effect"** showed me how **interactivity in web pages can serve as a gate** — where only specific actions unlock information. It was a fun and smooth transition from static inspection to observing **live client-side behavior**.
