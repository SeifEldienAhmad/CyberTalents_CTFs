## 🧩 My Third CTF Challenge

**"Iam legend"** was my third CTF on CyberTalents. It introduced me to a new concept: **JavaScript obfuscation**, specifically using a technique called **JSFuck** — an esoteric encoding method that uses only six characters to write JavaScript.

This challenge pushed me to analyze complex-looking code and find ways to decode it and understand the logic beneath.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- What **JSFuck** is and how it works.
- How obfuscation can be used to hide logic, clues, or flags.
- How to decode obfuscated JavaScript using online tools like **PoisonJS**.
- That not everything suspicious is immediately obvious — some things need to be unraveled layer by layer.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Browser DevTools** – to inspect embedded scripts and page behavior.
- **External IDE** – for better viewing and formatting of JavaScript code.
- **PoisonJS** – to decode JSFuck-style obfuscated JavaScript.

## 📝 My Process (High-Level Overview)

1. Opened the challenge and viewed the page source.
2. Found suspicious-looking JavaScript — unreadable and heavily obfuscated.
3. Identified that the obfuscation was written using **JSFuck**.
4. Copied the code and used **PoisonJS** to decode it and reveal its purpose.
5. Traced the logic to uncover the flag or the final step needed to access it.

## 📌 Takeaway

**"Iam legend"** was a turning point in my CTF journey — the first time I had to decode obfuscated JavaScript. It taught me that **web challenges are not just about HTML forms and login pages — they can go deep into client-side scripting and trickery**.
